# Vulnerabiltiy a story - Passwords

Password security might be one of the oldest security systems in use,  the aim of this blog is to analyse how secure a comon "secure" 8 chars long password actully is and compare it to a 16 char long password (using recommended techniques for long passwords).


## Assumptions

### 8 Chars Long password

1. 8 characters long with 5 lower case (L), 1 nunber (N), 1 upper case (U) and 1 special character (S).
2. English language used as based with 26 lower case, 26 Upper Case, 0-9 numbers, `!@#$%^&*()` special chars.
3. Password structure, ULLLLLNS, to summarise any structure with the format described in point 1 above.
4. Equation to calculate number of possibe passwords `(5 x 26 lower case) * (26 Upper Case) * (10 numbers) * (10 Special Chars) = 338000`

### 1 Chars long password

1. 16 characters long with nunber, uppercase and special characters.
2. Password will be based on random words from the english dictionary, eg: 
`Ch@r!ot.P4tr10t.`
3. Calculations will be based on techniques used by Hashcat and a video card with a power of 1^10 hashes per day
4. Average lifespan of 80 years which equates to approximately 29200 days at 365 days per year
5. Video Card cost of US$300 and a overall sytem cost of UD$1000.

## How hard would it be to carck and how much would it cost 

A 16 characters password with normal special character set would equate to:

`8 (special chars) x 52 (lower and upper case letters) x 10 (numbers) = 4160^16 (characters long) ~ 8^57 `

Using hashcat at a speed of `1^10 per day` we would get:

`8^57/1^10 = 3^51 days`

which would equate to approximately `1^47 lifetimes`

Now if we increase the computing power:

| # of VC | Calculation <br> 8^57 / #VC^10 <br> (Days) | Lifetimes | Cost <br> #VC*300+1000<br> (USD)|
|---------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
|1        |	2.99316E+51 |	1.02505E+47    |	$1,300|
|2        |	2.923E+48   |   1.00103E+44    |    $1,600|
|3        |	5.06893E+46 |	1.73594E+42	   |    $1,900|
|10       |	2.99316E+41 |	1.02505E+37    |	$4,000|
|100      |	2.99316E+31 |	1.02505E+27    |	$3,1000|
|1000     |	2.99316E+21 |	1.02505E+17    |	$301,000|
|10000    |	299315535325|	10250532.03    |	$3,001,000|
|100000   |	29.93155353 |	0.001025053203 |	$30,001,000|
|200000	  | 0.029230033	|   0.000001001029 |	$60,001,000|

In order to crack a 16 chars long password using current technologies in 29 days, it would cost approximately $30 millions and require approximately 100,000 video cards in a system that does not exist to the authors knowledge.

Now lets reduce the complexity of the password to 6 random characters, eg, `pA2%X8vU` using the calculation specified above:

`8 (special chars) x 52 (lower and upper case letters) x 10 (numbers) = 4160^8 (characters long) ~ 8.97^28 `

and we get

| # of VC | Calculation <br> 8.97^28 / #VC^10 <br> (Days) | Lifetimes | Cost <br> #VC*300+1000<br> (USD)|
|---------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
|1        |	4.76638E+26	|   1.63232E+22	   |    $1,300|
|400	  | 4.545571485	|   0.000155670    |	$121,000|

With a complexity of 6 chars:

| # of VC | Calculation <br> 5.2^21 / #VC^10 <br> (Days) | Lifetimes | Cost <br> #VC*300+1000<br> (USD)|
|---------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
|1        |	1.0866E+15  |	37212372949	   |    $1,300|
|30       |	1.840168826	|   0.000063019    |    $10,000|
